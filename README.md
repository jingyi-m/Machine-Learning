# Machine Learning
This is a classification problem to predict if there is a click for each entry row for on-line advertisements. The training data has more than 30 million rows. We tried several types of models including lasso regression, random forest, stepwise-forwards-selection logistic regression, and neural network. Our best models come from lasso regression and random forest. We ensembled them to make our final prediction for the test data.
